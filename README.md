# TEAM - Tennis Emotion Analysis for Mates 🎾🧠
### University Course: Affective Computing
### Academic Year: 2024/2025

### 📌 About This Repository
TEAM (Tennis Emotion Analysis for Mates) is a theoretical model designed to analyze emotions and team chemistry in doubles tennis. The project proposes a framework using computer vision and deep learning techniques to study facial expressions, body gestures, and synchronized movements between teammates.

🚨 Important: This project is purely conceptual and does not involve practical implementation. The objective of the course is to write a Grant Proposal, a document that outlines the research, proposed methodology, and expected impact.

### 🎯  Project Goal
✔️ Recognize players' emotional states during key match moments \
✔️ Assess team chemistry through synchronization, emotional congruence, and interaction quality \
✔️ Analyze the correlation between emotions, game events, and performance

### 🛠️ Proposed Technologies
Although this project is only theoretical, the model is based on advanced AI and computer vision tools, including:

🔹 ResNet50 – Facial expression analysis \
🔹 OpenPose – Posture and movement recognition \
🔹 YOLO – Player detection and tracking \
🔹 SlowFast Networks – Game event identification

### 📄 Exam Project: Grant Proposal
This repository contains only the Grant Proposal, the required document for the course exam. The document includes:

- Introduction to the problem and research objectives \
- Literature review and identified gaps \
- Detailed description of the proposed theoretical framework \
- Methodology and analysis techniques \
- Scientific and economic impact of the project

### 🚀 Impact & Future Directions
TEAM serves as an innovative theoretical model for studying emotional dynamics and teamwork in doubles tennis. While it is not being developed at this stage, the framework could inspire future research in Affective Computing and Sports Analytics.
